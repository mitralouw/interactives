        <h2 id="header">Skill Showcase: investigating of Evanston's trees</h2>
        <p> Evanston is a city that values its trees. In fact, the city’s data portal maintains a database of
            every single tree in the city — dead or alive — that lists its location and species. I decided to do a
            deep-dive into this data portal and see if I could find any interesting patterns. Using Python and
            Flourish, I performed exploratory data analysis, asked questions about what I found, and wrote the
            answers into a short story complete with explanatory data visualizations. This is my process; an
            abridged version of it, at least.
        </p>
        <p>
            Evanston’s Open Data Portal (most cities have something similar) is a fantastic resource for the intrepid
            data journalist. Simply select one of the eight sections and start scrolling; all the data is freely
            available and easy to download in .csv format. Some datasets even have built-in map views that do some
            of the work for you. The one that piqued my interest was found in the “Parks, Recreation and Community
            Services” section: it lists each one of Evanston’s 34,000 individual trees, along with its species, genus,
            stage in life cycle and location.
        </p>

        <p>
            Trees! Fun. So, I downloaded the dataset as a csv file and uploaded that into Python (I use a Jupyter
            notebook
            as a holdover from my data science course sequence but CoLab would probably have been easier). It was time
            to
            start exploring.
        </p>

        <p>
            I started out simple, getting a feel for the shape and range of the data using “.describe” and “.head.” I
            immediately noticed the column names needed cleaning, so I renamed the “DBH” column to “diameter” and made
            the “Common Name” column one word for easier indexing. 
        </p>
        <div class="box">
            <pre>
                <code class = "language-python line-numbers" data-prismjs-copy="copy the HTML snippet!">
                trees = trees.rename(columns = {'DBH':'diameter', 'Common name':'common_name'})
    
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>

        <p>
            I knew I wanted to create a point map with latitude and longitude, so I separated those into two columns. 
        </p>

        <div class="box">
            <pre>
                <code class = "language-python line-numbers" data-prismjs-copy="copy the HTML snippet!">
                    trees[['na', 'Longitude', 'Latitude']] = trees['the_geom'].str.split(' ', expand = True)
                    trees.Longitude = trees['Longitude'].str.replace('(', '')
                    trees.Latitude = trees['Latitude'].str.replace(')', '')
                    trees = trees.drop(['the_geom', 'na'], axis = 1)
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
        <p>
            Next, I wanted to see if there were any patterns in the data. I got the counts of trees in each life 
            cycle stage: Active Tree, Planting Site, Removed Tree or Stump. The removed trees in particular seemed 
            like an interesting thing to dig into. I filtered the dataset so it only included removed trees, and 
            uploaded it into Flourish --- a fantastic tool for creating data visualizations. I decided to color code 
            the dots by genus (species made the map too cluttered) and see if there were any patterns.
        </p>

        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/21927897"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/21927897/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="map visualization" /></noscript></div>
            
        <p>
            The map didn't reveal as much as I'd hoped. I realized I wanted to understand what species of trees 
            were removed most often. Deciding that the best way to visualize this would be a pie chart, I went back to Python
            and created a new dataset that included the counts of each genus, seperated by removed or living trees. 
        </p>


        <div class="box">
            <pre>
                <code class = "language-python line-numbers" data-prismjs-copy="copy the HTML snippet!">
                    removed_trees_countby = pd.DataFrame(removed_trees.Genus.value_counts())
                    trees_countby = pd.DataFrame(trees.Genus.value_counts())
                    tree_counts_merged = pd.merge(trees_countby, removed_trees_countby, on = 'Genus', how = 'outer')
                    tree_counts_merged.to_csv('/Users/mitranourbakhsh/Desktop/tree_counts_merged.csv')

                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>

        <p>
            I uploaded this new dataset into Flourish and created side-by-side donut charts, which revealed something 
            very interesting...
        </p>
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/21928183"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/21928183/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>
       
        <p>
            This observation -- that Ash trees make up a bigger proportion of removed trees than they do of living ones, with
            the opposite true for honey locusts -- led me to a natural reseach question: <strong> why is that?</strong> A quick Google search revealed 
            that Chicago and its surrounding suburbs have been battling the Emerald Ash Borer since 2002. Since then, the invasive species  
            has killed millions of ash trees across 35 states. The City of Chicago stopped
            inoculating its ash trees against the beetle in 2020, but there's no word on Evanston's policy. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The donut graph also shows that honey locusts are removed at a disproportionately low rate compared to 
            how many of them exist in Evanston. According the the Morton Arboretum, honey locusts are native to the Chicago area
            and, if anything, are too common. They reccomend homeowners only plant honey locusts after considering all other options
            that might better enhance species diversity. 
        </p>

        <p>
            This research explains why the data looks the way it does. If I were to write this into a news story,
            I would dig deeper into Evanston's treatment plan of the Emerald Ash Borer, especially considering the 
            December 2024 ordinance update that gives the city more control over trees on private property. But I will leave that for another time...
        </p>
