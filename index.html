    <p>
      Over the last ten years, economic outcomes for Americans without college
      degrees are improving. Some young adults are beginning to question the
      importance of pursuing further education, according to a recent
      <a
        href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2024/05/23/is-college-worth-it-2/"
        >Pew Research study</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only one-in-four U.S. adults say it’s extremely or very important to have
      a four-year college degree in order to get a well-paying job in today’s
      economy. Data shows that earnings of young men without a college degree
      have, in fact, been on the rise.

      Views on the subject, however, vary widely based on partisanship. The
      study also found that Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say
      that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It’s <i> not too </i> or <i> not at all </i> important to have a
        four-year four-year college degree in order to get a well-paying job
        (50% of Republicans vs. 30% of Democrats)
      </li>
      <li>
        A college degree is less important now than it was 20 years ago (57% vs.
        43%)
      </li>
      <li>
        It’s <i> extremely </i> or <i> very likely </i> someone without a
        four-year college degree can get a well-paying job (42% vs. 26%)
      </li>
    </ul>
